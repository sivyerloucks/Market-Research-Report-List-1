<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Treponema Pallidum Tests Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Treponemal Tests</li><li>Non-Treponemal Tests</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Treponema pallidum tests consist of two main types: treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Treponemal tests detect antibodies specific to Treponema pallidum, the bacterium causing syphilis, and are used for confirmatory diagnosis. Non-treponemal tests assess the presence of non-specific antibodies produced in response to the infection and are often used for initial screening. Together, these tests provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosing syphilis, guiding treatment decisions and monitoring disease progression or response to therapy.</p></p>
