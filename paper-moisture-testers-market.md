<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paper Moisture Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Testers</li><li>Non-contact Testers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The paper moisture testers market is divided into two primary types: contact testers and non-contact testers. Contact testers work by physically touching the paper surface, providing direct moisture readings through electrode measurement. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, utilize infrared or electromagnetic technology to gauge moisture levels without direct contact, making them suitable for delicate or bulk materials. Both types serve essential roles in industries like printing, packaging, and papermaking, ensuring quality control and preventing damage due to excess moisture.</p></p>
