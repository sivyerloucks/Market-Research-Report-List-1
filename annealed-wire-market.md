<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Annealed Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Black Annealed Wire</li><li>Bright Annealed Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The annealed wire market consists of two primary types: black annealed wire and bright annealed wire. Black annealed wire is typically produced by heating carbon steel, resulting in a dark finish due to oxidation, making it ideal for applications such as fencing and binding. In contrast, bright annealed wire undergoes a more refined heating process in an oxygen-free environment, resulting in a shiny, smooth surface suitable for electrical applications and manufacturing. Both types are valued for their enhanced malleability and reduced brittleness.</p></p>
