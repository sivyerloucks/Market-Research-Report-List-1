<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED and OLED Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive-matrix</li><li>Active-matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LED and OLED display markets are divided into passive-matrix and active-matrix configurations. Passive-matrix displays use a grid system to control pixels, resulting in lower power consumption but limited refresh rates and response times, making them suitable for simpler applications. Active-matrix displays, on the other hand, utilize thin-film transistors to individually control each pixel, offering higher resolution, faster refresh rates, and improved image quality. This makes active-matrix displays ideal for advanced applications like smartphones and high-definition televisions.</p></p>
